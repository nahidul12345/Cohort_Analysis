- **Dataset Source**: [Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail)  

## 📈 Dataset  

For this project, I used a simulated transactional dataset with the following key fields:  
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for customers.  
- `TransactionDate`: Date of each transaction.  
- `Sales`: Amount spent in each transaction.  
- `FirstPurchaseDate`: Date of the customer's first purchase.  

**Note:** Replace with your dataset to adapt the analysis to your business case.
